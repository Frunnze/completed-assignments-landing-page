## Short description
This is a landing page meant to present my completed university assignments like homeworks, tests, laboratories, and reports. It can easily help someone to contact me about purchasing a specific assignment.

## Navigation bar and home section
The navigation bar consists of four buttons that can get
you to a specific part of the web page. The bar is also sticky which means that it is always going to be at the top of the page. The home section consists of a header that presents the main purpose of the landing page and a picture for visual clarification. In addition, there is a "Buy" button which sends you to the contacts section.
